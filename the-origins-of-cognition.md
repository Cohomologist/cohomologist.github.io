## The origins of cognition

### Prologue

The first goal of any living thing is to live. The second goal of any living thing is to keep on living. Of course, you might be thinking: why do some bees sacrifice their own lives just to get a sting in? And you have a point here: I should be saying those are the goals of their [**genes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) instead. But for the most part, those goals are fundamental to all of life.

Ultimately, life is a problem of *control*. How can an organism control what happens to them in an unpredictable world that throws challenge after challenge? We know all about the many tools *we* have to solve that problem, but let's consider the other side of the coin.

We still have countless numbers of bacteria that survive to this day. [Cyanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria) are among the oldest species still alive and well on this Earth, dating back to 3.5 billion years ago. And despite their old age, it's almost as if bacteria are doing better than ever. You know the nukes we've deployed against them in the last century? If antibiotic resistance is already threatening to bring us back to the age of the plague doctor, then damn do bacteria adapt fast!

So what's the secret to immortality that bacteria have up their sleeve? They have three tremendous advantages that brought them from near the very origin of species, all the way to our current world.

<img src="/images/bacteriaadvantages.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />First, bacteria avoid interacting with the enviroment as much as possible. Most of the internal systems in bacteria are defensive: they don't look for opportunities, but instead scan their nearby surroundings for potential threats. And bacteria are born with all their means of survival in place, since mitosis simply involves copying the adult instead of producing children. They don't need to learn from their early experiences, so a hostile environment would not faze them.

Second, with such short lifespans, bacteria only need to play the game of life for mere minutes or hours before they win, and over time, they win big. All hail exponential growth! Despite their ephemeral nature, bacteria can still learn as a population, as while they don't live long before dividing, that just means they mutate very often.

And finally, bacteria are just *simple* beings. They don't need a lot of food, they don't really do much as individuals, and they usually just hover around with all their protective gear on until it's their turn to divide. There's just not much that could go wrong for them.

And that is the story of bacteria, but that could also have been the story of every species that lived. Why risk unnecessary interactions with the environment when a quiet approach to life simply worked?

Yet, at some point during our evolutionary history, the entire tune suddenly changed. 600 million years ago, the world had just escaped the brutal ice age before the Ice Age – the Cryogenian period. From then, the first animals emerged from the ashes... or should I say, from the frost. 

These new species had enough of their ancestors' fear of nature. They wanted to prove that it is not so bad to live an active life exploring the world. Of course, exploration is dangerous – at any moment, they might wander into a gruesome death. But that risk was worth it. If they could successfully find and use the resources they have on this Earth, they could live for longer than any of their ancestors could ever dream of. If they could form successful social groups that tackled the challenges of life together, they could conquer the natural world to a point where it's no longer a big deal. And if they could form their own cultures and convey it to generations to come, they could be etched into immortality.

All of those challenges require **cognition**: the ability to perceive the world correctly and to use that perception to guide action. Today, I will go over the origins of cognition: how did we come to know the world as we do today?

### Behavior as control

When engineers talk about *control*, they are talking about the problem of maintaining a system at a desirable state. To solve that problem, an engineer would design a separate **control system** that monitors the main system, performing actions whenever necessary to bring it towards a desirable state. For example, an autopilot is a control system that stabilizes an airplane by tracking its rotation on all three axes. Since we know how the airplane's elevators, rudders, and ailerons change its rotation, the autopilot can easily deal with any danger to the airplane's stability, by using those three controls according to simple rules.

But control is not only a problem in engineering. *Life* is a problem of control because living is all about controlling all the essential variables so that the organism can keep on living. Every organism strives to maintain **homeostasis** – the whole range of desirable states that ensures future survival. For humans, that includes controlling variables like body temperature, glucose, and heart rate. When an organism strays away from homeostasis for long enough, they simply kick the bucket.

<img src="/images/behaviorcontrol.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />It is so important to understand control, because most behavior has one ultimate goal: **to bring the organism towards a desirable state.** It seems obvious, yet it isn't obvious enough! Back in the old, old days of behaviorism, psychologists assumed that an organism's behavior was all about making responses to stimuli. But just think about this statement for a bit: *when an organism sees food, they eat it.* 

It might seem innocuous at first, but there is a huge problem: what if the organism is *full*? It isn't as easy as predicting that an organism will eat every time they see food. It's almost like we sometimes forget we're studying a living thing!

Instead, we want to think of it this way: when an organism is hungry, they will find a way to become full again, because hunger is a potential threat to survival. If there's food right next to them, then great, problem solved! Otherwise, they will look for food through various innate or learned strategies. Here, we are thinking of feeding in terms of control. An organism wants to control their satiety towards their desirable state of being full, and to do so, they have strategies that will bring them closer to that desirable state.

Furthermore, the world is an unpredictable place. If we view behavior as a matter of responding to stimuli, then what if the response didn't accomplish what the organism wanted? Often, they simply make the wrong decision, or they fail to reach their goal because of events beyond their control. If a mouse sees food, but suddenly a cat swoops in to take it, are they still going to chase the food? Or are they going to get the heck out of dodge as they should? Behavior is *interactive*: an organism always adapts its behavior based on feedback from their environment. Every action has a reaction that the organism has to consider.

> Yes, organisms do have some stimulus-response behaviors. But they're the exception, not the rule, as a stimulus-response behavior is one that can lead to disaster since they ignore environmental feedback.

So that's why we want to think of behavior as control: 

### Bacteria: wiser than you think

Let's consider how bacteria use control systems to feed themselves. Bacteria automatically feed on nutrients that are nearby, but how do they control how much they eat, and how do they move towards nutrient sources when there aren't any right next to them? I'll give two examples involving one of the most iconic bacteria of all: *E. coli*.

#### Example 1: Iron metabolism

Like most bacterial species, *E. coli* requires a steady intake of iron, but like anything in life, there can be too much of a good thing. So *E. coli* has [a simple, yet brilliant system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8381567/#:~:text=The%20PmrA%20response%20regulator%20and,chemical%20cues%20in%20the%20environment.) to control that intake.

<img src="/images/pmrsystem.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />When it detects that too much iron has breached its outer membrane, the system hardens the outer membrane to prevent any more iron from joining the party. From there, iron levels will taper off until things return to normal – which usually happens after  moving to a region with a lower iron concentration. Then, the system shuts off, allowing iron to flow in freely again. Yeah, that's basically it!

> **Technical details:** *E. coli* keeps this system (called PmrA/PmrB) active when it detects too many Fe<sup>3+</sup> (iron (III)) ions in its periplasm. While the system is active, *E. coli* positively charges its outer membrane by modifying its lipopolysaccharides to repel any extracellular Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Eventually, once levels return to normal, *E. coli* deactivates the system, so the outer membrane loses its positive charge. In the end, Fe<sup>3+</sup> can flow again, and everyone lives happily ever after.

It's important to realize that *E. coli* isn't simply reacting to a stimulus here. It simply cannot predict how long it will take for things to return to normal, because it doesn't have total control over its environment. All it can do is leave the system on until that happens. 

It's just like a thermostat: you set it to a given temperature, and the thermostat will control that temperature by using the house's HVAC system. When it's too cold, the thermostat commands it to heat the house, and when it's too hot, the thermostat commands it to cool the house. Once the temperature is the point you set it at, it doesn't have to do anything until the temperature fluctuates again.

A thermostat doesn't have to care about the temperature outside, nor whether you'll forget to close the windows. That's because it doesn't have to, and that's the best part! As long as the HVAC system heats the house when it's too cold, and cools the house when it's too hot, the temperature will eventually be where you want it to be. The thermostat is just there to ensure that's the case. It doesn't have to be an oracle that predicts every future temperature fluctuation – it just has to fight against those fluctuations. In an unpredictable world, genius is not an infinite capacity to predict the future, but an infinite capacity to take setbacks. 

#### From the stimulus to the impetus

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 5%;">   <img src="/images/feedbackcontrol.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 47.5%; height: auto;"> <img src="/images/thermostat.png" alt="Image 2" style="width: 47.5%; height: auto;"> </div>

What does the *E. coli* iron metabolism system and the thermostat have in common? They are both **feedback control** systems. They don't try to predict what will happen in the future, because the environment is beyond predicting. Instead, they constantly monitor feedback from the environment to see how distant the main system is from a desirable state. The control system performs actions towards the main system only to restore that desirable state when needed.

We can also think of it this way: when the environment knocks the main system off a desirable state, the control system now has an **impetus** to act. An impetus is not just a stimulus, but a condition which motivates action. If a thermostat knows that the current temperature is 70˚ F, then that's uninteresting on its own. But if it also knows that the user wants the temperature to be 72˚ F, now it has an impetus: the current temperature is below than the desired temperature. Now, the thermostat's job is to eliminate the impetus that motivated it to act in the first place. Luckily, it's easy: it simply turns on the heat until the temperature is 72˚ F.

#### Example 2: Voluntary movement through chemotaxis

Bacteria seem to wander around randomly, but they can actually wander as a means to an end. At least to an extent. Bacteria can move towards nutrient-rich regions through [chemotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis), which works through a simple feedback control system. *E. coli* has a interesting flavor of chemotaxis which actually uses a simple form of short-term memory to guide its behavior!

<img src="/images/chemotaxis.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />Unlike the food we eat, the nutrients that bacteria need are tiny particles scattered across their environment. *E. coli* can only measure the nutrient concentration right next to them. Furthermore, *E. coli* cannot directly control the direction it moves in. They can only either **run** in a straight line, or **tumble** to randomly change direction. Despite those limitations, *E. coli* has a briliant scheme that varies its *tumbling rate* (the average rate that it tumbles at) to move towards regions with better nutrient concentration.

> "It follows a simple strategy: If life is getting better, keep going, and if life is getting worse, change direction." – Uri Alon, *An Introduction to Systems Biology*

What *E. coli* ultimately wants to control is not the nutrient concentration itself, but instead the *improvement* in nutrient concentration. Unlike the first example, now we see *E. coli* becoming a bit more ambitious! As its other control systems already prevent it from overeating, *E. coli* is always looking for more nutrient-rich regions, even there are already enough nutrients to subsist on in its current position.

To do so, *E. coli* actually stores a moving average of the recent nutrient concentrations it has experienced. When the current nutrient concentration is above this average, that probably means things are improving. In this case, *E. coli* sets its tumbling rate to be lower so that it'll likely continue running in a straight line. Usually, if the nutrient concentration is increasing, then it'll keep improving for a bit as the cell keeps waltzing on forwards. On the other hand, when the nutrient concentration is below that average, that probably means things are worsening. So *E. coli* sets its tumbling rate to be higher, encouraging it to change its direction. Here, worsening conditions are the impetus for *E. coli* to quit going down its current path, and to find a better path that improves its conditions instead.

It's similar to how a treasure hunter would use a metal detector. If they walk forwards and the metal detector starts to beep faster, they should probably keep walking forward until they hopefully find the holy grail! Otherwise, it wouldn't hurt to explore and change course. 

Like the first example, this system is also a feedback control system. It constantly compares the current nutrient concentration to the recent history of concentrations, and sees whether it has improved its situation. If not, it adds a bit of chaos to the mix, changing the cell's direction until it finally achieves that improvement. 

#### Simple is stable

It's easy to think that primitive species – like those in the bacterial kingdom – are more unstable. Yet, the opposite is true, since primitive species have clear, simple goals defined by their genes. Generally, they need to have an impetus to defend those goals before they'll produce a clear behavior, since they are reluctant to take risks that threaten their immediate survival. They aren't just reacting to stimuli, but instead they always monitor the environment to determine whether there is a threat to a desirable state. So for the better part of our evolutionary history, organisms relied on feedback control systems for almost all their behavior.

#### Foreshadowing intelligence

Both of the systems we covered above seem fairly straightforward. They maintain a desirable state by performing simple actions against anything that disturbs that state. But there's a big difference in philosophy between the two.

The first system is just there to ensure the cell metabolizes iron properly, keeping iron concentration below a certain point. But the second system has a more ambitious goal. It drives the cell towards more nutrient-rich regions, even if there's already enough food where they are. It isn't enough for the cell to ensure it survive right now. It's only enough when the cell is doing everything it can to make sure it is far away from starvation as possible. Hopefully, even if the nutrient concetration plummets suddenly, there would be enough of a buffer to ensure it doesn't starve.

Furthermore, the second system foreshadows the next chapter in our evolutionary history. Bacteria are mostly passive creatures that were content with a short life, so long as it can live long enough to divide. But as the first **animals** had emerged, those species had to evolve new systems to fit their more ambitious goals. Systems that not only kept the organism stable for now, but systems that would keep the organism as far away from death as possible.

To that end, an organism would have to correctly perceive the world, recognize opportunities to improve its position in life, and act on those opportunities safely. To that end, an organism would have to be capable of cognition.

### Approaching the Cambrian explosion

All walls fall eventually.

In 1453, the Ottomans started a new era of their empire by penetrating the impenetrable walls of Constantinople. In 1989, the Berlin Wall started to fall. And 540 million years ago, the walls that separated living things from the environment started to crumble. During the [**Cambrian explosion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion), many of the first animals started to emerge. Intelligence, as we know it today, started to appear, as life became more complex than it had been ever before.

Unlike those that came before them, these new animals were not afraid to drop their walls and explore the world. They saw the environment not as a threat to avoid, but instead as a challenge to command and conquer. But to make that endeavor worthwhile, their ancestors had to develop the first rudiments of cognition. 

#### What is cognition?

This is surprisingly hard to answer!

Different people will have different answers to this question, because there are a lot of processes across many species that we could consider to be "cognitive". Are simple control systems like metabolism or chemotaxis cognitive? Or does cognition require something more? Furthermore, if we define cognition, we should be able to point out when in our evolutionary history did cognition start to emerge. But rarely does a completely new function like cognition appear out of thin air – instead, like a good watchmaker, evolution slowly assembles its pieces together.

Yet, answer this question I must. So to motivate things a bit, I will look at how the **nervous system** had evolved, starting from 750 million years ago leading up all the way to the Cambrian explosion.

#### Why do neurons exist?

<img src="/images/cellsignalling.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />Neurons are just another solution to a problem every organism has to solve: how do they convey information from one part of their body to another?

As unicellular organisms, bacteria use chains of chemical reactions to transmit signals within the cell. But to an extent, bacteria can also send signals to *other* bacteria, with some being even capable of talking to other species – even animals! 

---

For example, *V. fischeri* is a bioluminscent (light-producing) bacteria that lives in the Hawaiian bobtail squid (*Euprymna scolopes*), but this is actually a win-win situation for both!

The squid has a translucent light organ that houses *V. fischeri* bacteria. During the day, the bacteria gradually populate their light organ, but they doesn't want the bacteria to light up until nighttime – their idea is to hide their shadow from nocturnal predators using the light. Since *V. fischeri* also wants the squid to survive as they're a useful host, they have a clever system that ensures the entire *population* of bacteria in the light organ lights up at the right time.

*<img src="/images/vfischeri.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />V. fischeri* constantly releases an ensemble of signaling molecules called AHLs that circulate within the squid's light organ. However, *V. fischeri* also has receptors for those same molecules, mainly looking for those released by other *V. fischeri* cells. Once a *V. fischeri* cell detects a sufficient concentration of those molecules – or put another way, the population of *V. fischeri* cells exceeds a **quorum** (threshold) – they finally light up.

Note that the squid purges their light box of *V. fischeri* cells near the crack of dawn. So throughout this process, they maintain a nice little cycle:

- they accumulate *V. fischeri* during the day
- have the population reach their quorum at night so that they light up, and then 
- they reset the population before the next day begins.

In **quorum signalling**, bacteria release molecules to signal their presence, as well as measure the concentration of those molecules to estimate their population. It is just the simplest out of many ways that bacteria can communicate with each other. Bacteria can engage in collective behaviors – there was indeed a social world before the social animal.

---

We saw just one example of how cells can communicate with each other to accomplish something bigger. Whether we're talking about cells or humans, organisms are stronger when they work together.

So I want us to look at communication between cells as a basic form of **social behavior**. When we study bacteria, we study the entire *population* of bacteria in an environment as much as we do the individual cells themselves. Due to their collective behaviors, we could kind of treat the population as a multicellular organism in its own right!

>  After all, we often treat a group as an individual, for better or for worse of course.

Yet, meaning often gets lost in translation. As incredible as they are, the signalling mechanisms in bacteria are imprecise. Bacteria cannot choose which specific individual they want to talk to, since the messages they convey could easily get lost in their unstable environments. Imagine if every time you made a phone call, you couldn't use the recipient's name and everyone in your neighborhood would get to hear it!

<img src="/images/neuronpurpose.png" alt="negfb" style="width: 60%; float: right; padding: 10px" />If a multicellular organism wants to coordinate their senses and movements properly, that sort of signalling just won't cut it. Imagine if the organism had to move their entire body every time they wanted to move, because the signal to move just propagates to every part of their body. 

So around 750 million years ago, the **neuron** was born. Neurons were meant for signaling – they are different from other cells in a number of ways:

- they can choose which cells they send messages to, since they pass their signals through directed connections called **axons**. 
- they can control how sensitive they are to messages from a specific cell by modifying their **synapses**.
- they communicate with other cells by firing all-or-nothing **impulses** (either they fire at full strength or not at all), which can be reliably passed onto their targets.
