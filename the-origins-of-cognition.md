### Prologue

The first goal of any living thing is to live. The second goal of any living thing is to keep on living. Of course, you might be thinking: why do some bees sacrifice their own lives just to get a sting in? And you have a point here: I should be saying those are the goals of their [**genes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) instead. But for the most part, those goals are fundamental to all of life.

Ultimately, life is a problem of *control*. How can an organism control what happens to them in an unpredictable world that throws challenge after challenge? We know all about the many tools *we* have to solve that problem, but let's consider the other side of the coin.

We still have countless numbers of bacteria that survive to this day. [Cyanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria) are among the oldest species still alive and well on this Earth, dating back to 3.5 billion years ago. And despite their old age, it's almost as if bacteria are doing better than ever. You know the nukes we've deployed against them in the last century? If antibiotic resistance is already threatening to bring us back to the age of the plague doctor, then damn do bacteria adapt fast!

So what's the secret to immortality that bacteria have up their sleeve? They have three tremendous advantages that brought them from near the very origin of species, all the way to our current world.

First, bacteria avoid interacting with the enviroment as much as possible. Most of the internal systems in bacteria are defensive: they don't look for opportunities, but instead scan their nearby surroundings for potential threats. And bacteria are born with all their means of survival in place, since mitosis simply involves copying the adult instead of producing children. They don't need to learn from their early experiences, so a hostile environment would not faze them.

Second, with such short lifespans, bacteria only need to play the game of life for mere minutes or hours before they win, and over time, they win big. All hail exponential growth! Despite their ephemeral nature, bacteria can still learn as a population, as while they don't live long before dividing, that just means they mutate very often.

And finally, bacteria are just *simple* beings. They don't need a lot of food, they don't really do much as individuals, and they usually just hover around with all their protective gear on until mitosis says it's their turn to divide. There's just not much that could go wrong for them.

And that is the story of bacteria, but that could have also be the story of every species that lived. Why risk unnecessary interactions with the environment when a quiet approach to life simply worked?

Yet, at some point during our evolutionary history, the entire tune suddenly changed. Around 600 million years ago, the world had just escaped the brutal ice age before the Ice Age – the Cryogenian period. From then, the first animals emerged from the ashes... or should I say, from the frost. 

These new species had enough of their ancestors' fear of nature. They were determined to prove that it is not so bad to live an active life exploring the world. Of course, exploration is dangerous – at any moment, they might wander into a gruesome death.

But that risk was worth it. If they could successfully find and use the resources they have on this Earth, they could live for longer than any of their ancestors could ever dream of. If they could form successful social groups that tackled the challenges of life together, they could conquer the natural world to a point where it's no longer a big deal. And if they could form their own cultures and convey it to generations to come, they could be etched into immortality.

All of those challenges require **cognition**: the ability to perceive the world correctly and to use that perception to guide action. Today, I will go over the origins of cognition: how did we come to *know* the world as we do today?

### It starts with control

When engineers talk about *control*, they are talking about the problem of maintaining a system at a desirable state. To solve that problem, engineers design separate **control systems** that perform actions to the main system. For example, an autopilot is a control system that stabilizes an airplane by tracking its rotation on all three axes. Since we know how the airplane's elevators, rudders, and ailerons change its rotation, the autopilot can easily deal with any danger to the airplane's stability by using those three controls according to simple rules.

But control is not only a problem in engineering. *Life* is a problem of control because living things need to control all the essential variables to ensure that they keep on living. Every organism strives to maintain **homeostasis** – the whole range of desirable states that ensures future survival. When an organism strays away from homeostasis for long enough, they simply kick the bucket.

It is so important to understand control, because almost all behavior has an ultimate goal: to bring the organism towards homeostasis – towards that range of desirable states. It seems obvious, but yet it isn't obvious enough! Back in the old, old days of behaviorism, psychologists assumed that an organism's behavior is all about making predictable responses to stimuli. But just think about this statement for a bit: *when an organism sees food, they eat it.* 

It might seem innocuous at first, but there is a huge problem: what if the organism is *full*? It isn't as easy as predicting that an organism will eat every time they see food. It's almost like we sometimes forget we're studying a living thing!

Instead, we want to think of it this way: when an organism is hungry, they will find a way to become full again, because hunger is a potential threat to survival. If there's food right next to them, then great, problem solved! Otherwise, they will look for food through various innate or learned strategies. Here, we are thinking of feeding in terms of control. An organism wants to control their satiety towards their desirable state of being full, and to do so, they have strategies that will bring them closer to that desirable state.

Furthermore, the world is an unpredictable place. If we viewed behavior as a matter of responding to stimuli, then what if the response didn't accomplish what the organism wanted? Often, they simply make the wrong decision, or they fail to reach their goal because of events beyond their control. If a mouse sees food, but suddenly a cat swoops in to take it, are they still going to chase the food? Or are they going to get the heck out of dodge as they should? Behavior is *interactive*: an organism always adapts its behavior based on feedback from their environment. Every action has a reaction that the organism has to consider.

> Yes, organisms do have some stimulus-response behaviors. But they're the exception, not the rule, as a stimulus-response behavior is one that can lead to disaster since they ignore environmental feedback.

Let's consider how bacteria use control systems to feed themselves. Bacteria automatically feed on nutrients that are nearby, but how do they control how much they eat, and how do they move towards nutrient sources when there aren't any right next to them? I'll give two examples involving one of the most iconic bacteria of all: *E. coli*.

---

Like most bacterial species, *E. coli* requires a steady intake of iron, but like anything in life, there can be too much of a good thing. So *E. coli* has [a simple, yet brilliant system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8381567/#:~:text=The%20PmrA%20response%20regulator%20and,chemical%20cues%20in%20the%20environment.) to control that intake.

When it detects that too much iron has breached its outer membrane, the system hardens the outer membrane to prevent any more iron from joining the party. From there, iron levels will taper off until things return to normal and the system shuts off, allowing iron to flow in freely again. Yeah, that's basically it.

> **Technical details:** *E. coli* keeps this system (called PmrA/PmrB) active when it detects too many Fe<sup>3+</sup> (iron (III)) ions in its periplasm. While the system is active, *E. coli* positively charges its outer membrane to repel any extracellular Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Eventually, once levels return to normal, *E. coli* deactivates the system, so the outer membrane loses its positive charge. In the end, Fe<sup>3+</sup> can flow again, and everyone lives happily ever after.

It's important to realize that *E. coli* isn't simply reacting to a stimulus here. It simply cannot predict how long it will take for things to return to normal, because it doesn't have total control over its environment. All it can do is leave the system on until that happens. 

It's just like a thermostat: you set it to a given temperature, and the thermostat will control that temperature by using the house's HVAC system. When it's too cold, the thermostat commands it to heat the home, and when it's too hot, the thermostat commands it to cool the house. Once the temperature is the point you set it at, it doesn't have to do anything until the temperature fluctuates again.

A thermostat doesn't have to care about the temperature outside, nor whether you'll forget to close the windows. That's because it doesn't have to, and that's the best part! As long as the HVAC system heats the house when it's too cold, and cools the house when it's too hot, the temperature will eventually be where you want it to be. The thermostat is just there to ensure that's the case. It doesn't have to be an oracle that predicts every future temperature fluctuation – it just has to fight against those fluctuations. In an unpredictable world, genius is not an infinite capacity to predict the future, but an infinite capacity to take setbacks. 

Both the *E. coli* system and the thermostat are **feedback control** systems. They don't try to predict what will happen in the future, because the environment is unpredictable. Instead, they monitor feedback from the environment to see how distant the main system is from a desirable state, and they perform actions that would likely close that gap. Any time a feedback control system produces behavior, it isn't just a reflex, but instead a deliberate attempt to bring the reality closer to the goal. They engage in a constant dialogue with the environment to adapt to its changing conditions.

Bacteria seem to wander around randomly, but they can actually wander as a means to an end. At least to an extent. Bacteria can move towards nutrient-rich regions through [chemotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis), which works through a simple feedback control system. *E. coli* has a interesting flavor of chemotaxis which actually uses a simple form of short-term memory to guide its behavior!

Unlike the food we eat, the nutrients that bacteria need are tiny particles scattered across their environment. *E. coli* can only measure the nutrient concentration right next to them. Furthermore, *E. coli* cannot directly control the direction it moves in. They can only either **run** in a straight line, or **tumble** to randomly change direction. Despite those limitations, *E. coli* has a briliant scheme that varies its *tumbling rate* (the average rate that it tumbles at) to move towards regions with better nutrient concentration.

> "It follows a simple strategy: If life is getting better, keep going, and if life is getting worse, change direction." – Uri Alon, *An Introduction to Systems Biology*

What *E. coli* ultimately wants to control is not the nutrient concentration itself, but instead the *improvement* in nutrient concentration. Unlike the first example, now we see *E. coli* becoming a bit more ambitious! As its other control systems already prevent it from overeating, *E. coli* is always looking for more nutrient-rich regions, even there are already enough nutrients to subsist on in its current position.

To do so, *E. coli* actually stores a moving average of the recent nutrient concentrations it has experienced. When the current nutrient concentration is above this average, that probably means things are improving. In this case, *E. coli* sets its tumbling rate to be lower so that it'll likely continue running in a straight line. Usually, if the nutrient concentration is increasing, then it'll keep improving for a bit as the cell keeps waltzing on forwards. On the other hand, when the nutrient concentration is below that average, that probably means things are worsening. So *E. coli* sets its tumbling rate to be higher, encouraging it to change its direction. 

It's similar to how a treasure hunter would use a metal detector. If they walk forwards and the metal detector starts to beep faster, they should probably keep walking forward until they hopefully find the holy grail! Otherwise, it wouldn't hurt to explore and change course. 

Like the first example, this system is also a feedback control system. It constantly compares the current nutrient concentration to the recent history of concentrations, and sees whether it has improved its situation. If not, it adds a bit of chaos to the mix, changing the cell's direction until it finally achieves that improvement.

We often think that primitive species like bacteria are more unstable, but the opposite is true. Primitive species have clear, simple goals specified by their genes. To achieve those goals, they mainly use feedback control systems which are incredibly reliable. That's because those systems take as little risk as possible – if there's even a potential danger looming on the horizon, they immediately shield the organism from that danger. This is similar to how an autopilot merely tries to keep the plane stable, while leaving the actual navigation to the pilot. So for the better part of our evolutionary history, organisms relied on feedback control systems, because they were unwilling (but not entirely uncapable) of taking risks that threatened their immediate survival.

### Foreshadowing intelligence

Both of the systems we covered above seem fairly straightforward. They maintain a desirable state by performing simple actions against anything that disturbs that state. But the second system is actually a seismic leap from the first, and I'll explain why with an analogy.

We often compare life to a big game of chess, so I want to put the spotlight on one of its greatest innovators: [Aron Nimzowitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Nimzowitsch). During his time, chess players were swashbucklers: they treated defense as an afterthought, and just tried to put the enemy king in a corner as soon as they could. But Nimzowitsch realized that chess wasn't about flashy maneuvers and reckless regard for safety. He realized that chess is ultimately about **positioning**. As much as the game is about checkmating, it's also a game of ensuring you are as many turns away from losing as possible. 

Perhaps his most important precept was to **overprotect** the most important pieces on his board. It wasn't enough to merely stop the enemy from capturing an important piece next turn. He made sure that the enemy would have the most agonizing time should they try to attack it. To him, not only would the important piece become even more important because it's safe from attack, but it also gives the other pieces protecting it a bigger purpose – a center of gravity to pour their best effort into. 

When I read Nimzowitsch's book [*My System*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_System), I couldn't help but notice something profound. Whereas players who came before him thought in terms of *activity*, he thought in terms of *control*. To his ancestors, chess was all about lighting as fierce of a fire as you could on the board. But to Nimzowitsch, chess was about identifying what makes your position good, then doing everything you can to ensure it stays that way. Today, while many, many years have passed since his generation, chess players still approach the game very much in his image. It's all about recognizing those desirable board states, then using a variety of strategies to get there. It's all about control.

So why is the second system a seismic leap from the first? Well, the first system is just there to ensure the cell metabolizes iron properly, keeping iron concentration below a certain point. But the second system has a more ambitious goal. It drives the cell towards more nutrient-rich regions, even if there's already enough food where they are. It isn't enough for the cell to ensure it survive right now. It's only enough when the cell is doing everything it can to make sure it is far away from starvation as possible. Hopefully, even if the nutrient concetration plummets suddenly, there would be enough of a buffer to ensure it doesn't starve. That's an approach to life that Nimzowitsch would be very happy with!

Furthermore, the second system foreshadows the next chapter in our evolutionary history. Bacteria are mostly passive creatures that were content with a short life, so long as it can live long enough to divide. But as the first **animals**, and especially **chordates**, had emerged, those species had to evolve new systems, similar to those Nimzowitsch wanted chess players to adopt. Systems that not only kept the organism stable for now, but systems that would keep the organism as far away from death as possible.

To that end, an organism would have to correctly perceive the world, recognize opportunities to improve its position in life, and act on those opportunities safely. To that end, an organism would have to be capable of **cognition**.
