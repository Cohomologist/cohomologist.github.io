Ivan Pavlov never intended to be a psychologist. After all, he lived in a time where philosophers were supposed to be the only ones studying the mind, and psychology was little more than a couple fun experiments. Indeed, he was first and foremost a physiologist who was more interested in the body than in the mind. But one day, all of that changed.

Pavlov was doing an experiment on dogs' digestive processes, and he kept track of their salivation with an apparatus so elaborate, that you wouldn't know that he found his most famous discovery by accident! Indeed, he noticed that as his dogs were becoming more used to the laboratory, they started to salivate whenever they had *anticipated* food, not just when they had seen or smelled food. It seemed like they could tell when food is coming just from cues like the rolling wheels of a food cart. So in 1897, Pavlov published the first ever paper on what we now know as **classical conditioning**. Ever since, leagues of psychology students have had to sit through a lecture about it, memorize it, and chug it on their final.

Usually, textbooks and lecturers illuminate classical conditioning using one of Pavlov's experiments: at first, the dog would hear a bell (the conditioned stimulus) at the same time they would sense food (the unconditioned stimulus). Usually, dogs salivate at the first sight or sound of food so they can prepare to digest it. But after a few trials, the dogs started to salivate when they heard the bell alone, even when the food is nowhere. It had seemed like the dog had learned a new behavior: salivate because of a bell, not just because of food!

Okay, that is certainly interesting, but what's the point? We learn that it is a key learning process, but learning to salivate at the ding of a bell sounds nothing like the learning we do.

### It's not about the spit

We shouldn't focus on the salivation.

Of course, Pavlov just wanted to put his hypothesis to the test, but the situation he posed was a bit facetious: a dog doesn't get much from salivating because of the bell. But I have a better example.

Consider an animal who sits on lower levels of the food chain, and has to spend much of their time fleeing from predators. Unlike many things in life, this is literally a life-or-death situation. There is no time to waste against a predator that wants to make them an easy meal. There is only a small window to get the heck out of dodge.

Luckily, as dangerous as predators are, predators also tend to be loud. The animal can easily hear when a predator is about to strike. The loud footsteps of a rampaging predator are not just loud footsteps, they are a sign of doom emerging on the horizon. If the animal wastes time thinking about what the loud footsteps mean, that could be their very last thought.

Through classical conditioning, the animal learns that they should not only be afraid when they see the predator right in their face (the conditioned stimulus), but they should also be afraid of any sign that a predator is approaching, such as footsteps (the unconditioned stimulus). Those aren't two separate stimuli that merit two separate responses, but instead one experience that merits one response. We aren't only limited to two stimuli: any number of stimuli that the animal can link to a single experience is fair game.

Indeed, classical conditioning is all about learning how to perceive the world as more than the sum of its parts. Pavlov's dog might be living in a more peaceful world (even though they weren't big on the "ethics" thing back then), but the dog would find it perfectly sensical to salivate in response to the bell. If the bell seems to always ring every time they get their treats, then why treat those events differently? The ringing bell doesn't seem like just a ringing bell, but instead the start of a single experience: they're about to be eating good! And yes, Pavlov did eventually experiment with ringing the bell while not giving Fido her treats in the end, and eventually Fido realized what was up and stopped salivating. But still, as unpredictable as the environment can be, the experiences we encounter can still have predictable beginnings. 

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and prevention is all about recognizing a threat as early as possible. At the same time, the early birds are those who see the worm while the others see nothing. Classical conditioning makes it all happen. Or at least, it's the start.

### Beyond Pavlov

When we talk about classical conditioning, we usually talk about Pavlov's original finding: animals will learn to perform an innate response to anything, as long as you pair it with the original thing it had the innate response to in the first place. When we present it like that, it's no wonder why it seems like a neat quirk more than anything.

Even if the world is unpredictable, it is still built from predictable patterns. If the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, then we should be able to perceive the whole when we see its parts all lining up in front of us.

Whenever we read, we don't care about the individual words. We care about how those words assemble together to create phrases. To create clauses. To create sentences. To create meaning. And meaning is the key to all of this.

Classical conditioning is only the beginning to a certain narrative during our evolutionary history. One of how we no longer just measured our worlds, we started to create meaning from our worlds. One of how our senses turned into our perception.

In classical conditioning, we start with an experience that already has innate meaning to us, and we learn how to recognize that experience better. But eventually, we evolved the ability to learn about the value of our experiences through **operant conditioning**. No longer were our behaviors fixed by our genes. Instead, we could learn what is good and what is bad. But still, most of our experiences are not just a single stimulus, but rather a constellation of stimuli that combine into a meaningful whole. Even in operant conditioning, we can associate stimuli together and represent them as a single experience. For example, rats can learn to navigate a maze for food, even if only the final turn in the maze gets them the holy grail. They're able to learn that the journey matters as much as the destination.

We still tend to study more the stimulus and less the experience when we study conditioning, but that's just a legacy of behavioral psychology. Researchers used to conduct simple experiments that isolated only the observable behaviors of a living thing. Of course they recognized that there was a mind inside a brain, but that was too exotic, too speculative. Nowadays, that tune has changed. Cognitive psychologists were way more eager to look behind the scenes, and neuroscientists could at last chime in on our cognitive processes with the invention of fMRI. Today, we aren't afraid to do elaborate experiments that go beyond what we see at first sight, and we have an emerging idea of why we behave the way we do. We don't just study dogs salivating or rats pressing a lever for food. We now want to study how our brain constructs a narrative of our lives, and uses that narrative to thrive in the world.

Indeed, quite recently, we had evolved the ability to *retell* our experiences, not just learn from them. We store each experience in our life in our **episodic memory**, and it only takes a single experience for us to remember it forever. We might only be able to live life forwards, but now we can understand life backwards, and use that understanding to guide our future action. But similar to classical and operant conditioning, we can combine the parts into a whole. When we think about our past experiences, we can understand how they fit into a bigger picture. A bunch of bad days at work isn't just a bunch of bad days at work, it's time to look for a new gig. Realizing that we have misunderstood someone isn't just consolation, it's forgiveness. When we combine our experiences into a meaningful whole, it becomes knowledge. **Semantic memory** encompasses all of that knowledge, and it is the final chapter to this narrative.

Classical conditioning associates multiple stimuli to a single experience, but an experience is still a concrete thing. Some animals who have no concept of the abstract are still capable of classical conditioning, because it's still useful to recognize every part of an experience. But operant conditioning involves something more abstract: value. Why do we deem some things *rewarding*, and other things *punishing*? That is a question every person has to answer throughout their lives, and people from different walks from life will have different answers. So operant conditioning is not only about helpless rats in Skinner boxes, it's the start to developing our own *personalities*.

Eventually, through episodic and semantic memory, we can not only work through our past in our minds, but we can elaborate upon our past to understand the world as a whole. As Plato taught us, behind every concrete experience in the world is its *form*: our representation of what it is and what it means. Thousands of years ago, way before psychology, philosophers were already thinking about what it meant to know. Is knowledge more than just knowing things, but also knowing the qualities that those things have and how those things relate to other things? Nowadays, I doubt many would disagree that the answer is yes, and we are finding out more and more about how we turn concrete experiences into abstract knowledge.

So classical conditioning is not just a neat little trick. Pavlov's discovery is a milestone in our millennia-long quest to answer one of the most basic questions there is: what does it mean to know?
